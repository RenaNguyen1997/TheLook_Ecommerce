# TheLook_Ecommerce
## Overview
This project showcases key data analysis skills and competencies used to extract insights from real-world datasets. The portfolio includes projects highlighting skills such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, statistical analysis, and reporting

## Key Skills Demonstrated: 

* Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and normalizing data. 

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships in data. 

* Data Visualization: Using Power BI to create compelling charts and graphs. 

* SQL: For querying databases, manipulating datasets, and performing calculations. 

* Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical techniques cohort analysis to study churning rate.

## Project setup
To run this project, you will need: 

* Access to the Power BI Desktop for visual reporting. 

* An account to create project on Google Cloud  

* Microsoft Excel to save the data or any offline saving data format that well cooperate with Power BI

## Project Structure 

* Data source:  [TheLook-E-commerce Bigquerry](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=thelook_ecommerce&page=dataset&authuser=1&project=tough-gearing-422905-s2&supportedpurview=project&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2sthelook_ecommerce!3sdistribution_centers)  

* **Google Clouds account:** To write and run the code.  

* **MS Excel:** Obtained data will be save under .xls format and upload on Power BI for visualizations 

* **Reports:** Final reports in PDF or Power BI format.

## How to Run the Project 

*For obtain raw data before visualization* 

1. Create a personal project on Google Cloud  

2. Click on the link to access the data source, then choose the created project to store any coding related to this project  

3. Look for the plus sign on the right side of the table and click on the sign to open blank page for start writing SQL  

4. Copy the code from a chunk each time to run the code 

5. After data is created, choose the option to save the data to your local computer  

*For using the visualization*  

Download the Power BI file in this link and use Desktop Power BI for further exploratory  

## Key Analysis and Visualizations 

* **Executive summary:** Summary the key bussiness performance  

* **Customer and total orders:** Relationship between customers and total order by time (Year, month, day) 

* **Revenue:** Total revenue and revenue growth after each year 

* **Cohort Analysis:** Identify churning patterns and summary the total churning rate after years 

## Insights and Findings 

* **Insight 1:** Customer distribution between two genders within all age ranges was equal. An outstanding number of customers were recorded for ages 12 -20, 41-48, and 62-70.  

* **Insight 2:** Though the general revenue trend is increasing, some specific months repeatedly experience a sudden fall over the year, which needs thorough understanding (February, May, September, and December) 

* **Insight 3:** Looking at Retention Cohort Analysis 

*While retention rates remained low for consecutive years, they rose abnormally in the first quarter of 2024. The Look company might have established a promotion program that works with its customers' target audience.*
